title: "Not tweeting since March 2023"
---

It's been a while since the last update, but just letting you know that since [March 2023 or block 780443](https://nitter.net/nolim1t/status/1634846913022545921) that I'm not tweeting anymore.

My reasons for liking it is similar to the reasons [here](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr/blob/master/README.md)

They are

## Dislikes

- Ads
- Feed algorithms rather than recent chronological posts

## Likes

- Censorship resistance. Post whatever you like
- Monetizeable posts without permission (Anyone can partake and earn money)

## Summary

Check out [this link](https://www.nostrapps.com/) if you're not onboard yet.
